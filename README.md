FCtrlA is a package of tools for X-ray hydrostatic mass calculation of XCS clusters using the Clmass extension to XSPEC. 
Package Contents:

* FatController.py
* ThomasTemplates.py
* HaroldHelper.py
* PercyPlotter.py

------

# Requirements
FCtrlA requires the installation of a number of other packages:

* Astropy v1.1.1 or newer
* SAS
* HEASoft 6.17 (with Xspec)
* Clmass (a version which has been edited to work with HEASoft 6.17

Installation of these packages can be done by following their respective guides. Good luck!

# Code

###FatController
FatController requires an Observation ID, right-ascension, declination, redshift and R<sub>500</sub> of a cluster, as well as a number of optional arguments detailed below, and makes use of the Clmass package to calculate a cluster's M<sub>500</sub>.

The process is as follows:
 
* Phase 1a:
    * Generate a local image
    * Convert XAPA regions from image coordinates to degrees (using the fk5 reference frame, Fricke et al., 1988)
    * Identify the XAPA source region corresponding to the cluster of interest, and flag this region with a comment
* Phase 1b:
  * Convert the provided R<sub>500</sub> to physical coordinates (after converting it to degrees when it is read in)
  * Convert XAPA regions from degrees to physical coordinates
  * Calculate shell boundaries
  * Identify physical coordinates of cluster in observation from the flag in the XAPA region file
  * Generate a masking string of non-cluster XAPA sources, to be ignored in spectal extraction
*  Phase 2a:
  * Extract spectra from N concentric annuli, with outer radiuses increasing by factor F each time
  * Extract a background spectrum
  * Backscale the extracted regions
  * Generate an RMF file from the innermost annulus
* Phase 2b:
  * Generate ARF files for each extracted spectrum
* Phase 2c:
  * Group spectrum, background, ARF and RMF files
  * Add XFLT keyword to the FITS headers containing shell outer boundary in arcseconds
* Phase 3:
  * Symlink files from Clmass package to working directory
  * Find initial values for cluster temperature and fraction of neutral Hydrogen
  * Format a template XSPEC script and save to an <code>xcm</code> script
  * Run the <code>xcm</code> script and log the output
  * Scrape the output for cluster M<sub>500</sub> in model mass units, and model mass unit to solar mass conversion.

####FatController arguments:

* <code>-o < ></code>: XMM Observation ID of target cluster
* <code>-r < ></code>: Right ascension of cluster in degrees in the fk5 reference system
* <code>-d < ></code>: Declination of cluster in degrees in the fk5 reference system
* <code>-z < ></code>: Redshift of cluster
* <code>-r500</code>: R<sub>500</sub> of cluster in kiloparsecs
* Optional flags:
  * <code>-j</code>:  Enable Apollo job submission
  * <code>-m</code>:  Constrain density function to be monotonic
* Optional additional arguments:
  * <code>-N < ></code>: Number of annuli to use
  * <code>-F < ></code>: Shell radius factor (r<sub>i</sub> = R<sub>500</sub>/F<sup>N-i-2</sup>, i in [0,N))

Note that shells go out beyond R<sub>500</sub>
A907 cluster example:
python FatController.py -o 0201903501 -r 149.5916 --deg 11.0642 -z 0.1605 -R 1095 -


##ThomasTemplates

ThomasTemplates provides an easy way of generating a syntactically correct json file containing all required template commands for FatController. It need only be edited to add a template command, or to update commands for updated software packages.


##HaroldHelper

HaroldHelper contains a series of functions designed to assist in the generation of FatController configurations. For example, <code>fc_from_csv</code> accepts a path to a csv file, and an optional delimiter, and will return a list of FatController commands for the provided clusters.


## PercyPlotter

PercyPlotter takes two arguments and creates a cluster mass profile.
1) The R500 radius of the cluster. 
2) The path to the clmass_script.xcm file. This file is located in the /code directory of the spec_... directory created by FatController.py

This program should be run from the directory above the spec_... folder of the cluster in question. 
<b> NB: It is likely that three errors pertaining to clmass files will be displayed when running PercyPlotter, this is not an issue! <b>ÃŸ
